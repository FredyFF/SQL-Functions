# SQL-Functions

Function is a series of SQL commands that are used to carry out specific tasks, but the difference with View is Functions can receive parameters (input), return values ​​(return results/output).

	Judging from its origins, functions can be divided into 2 types:
	1. SQL Server Built In Function: are functions that are provided by Microsoft SQL Server itself.
	2. User Defined Function: is a function created by the developer himself, not a function that is built-in from SQL Server.
